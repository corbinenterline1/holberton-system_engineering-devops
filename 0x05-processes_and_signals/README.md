 # 0x05 - System engineering & DevOps - Processes & signals
Task # | Short Description
-------|------------
[Task 0](0-what-is-my-pid) | Displays its' own PID
[Task 1](1-list_your_processes) | Displays a list of currently running processes.
[Task 2](2-show_your_bash_pid) | Displays processes containing the `bash` word.
[Task 3](3-show_your_bash_pid_made_easy) | Displays the PID, along with the process name, of processes whose name contain the word `bash`.
[Task 4](4-to_infinity_and_beyond) | Displays `To infinity and beyond` indefinitely.
[Task 5](5-kill_me_now) | Script that kills `4-to_infinity_and_beyond` process.
[Task 6](6-kill_me_now_made_easy) | Script that kills `4-to_infinity_and_beyond` process without using `kill` or `killall`.
[Task 7](7-highlander) | Displays `To infinity and beyond` indefinitely, with a `sleep 2` in between each iteration. `I am invincible!!!` when receiving a `SIGTERM` signal.
[Task 8](8-beheaded_process) | Script that kills the process `7-highlander`.
